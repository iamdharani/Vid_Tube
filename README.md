VIDTUBE ðŸŽ¬

VidTube is a frontend web application designed to simulate the basic functionality of YouTube. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project focuses on creating a responsive and interactive interface where users can search for videos and play them in an embedded video player.

Note : At this stage, I have only added the homepage interaction and video play interaction. More features may be added in the future.


KEY FEATURES :

Search Functionality : Users can type into the search bar to find and play specific videos, similar to YouTubeâ€™s search feature.
Video Playback : A video player with basic controls allows users to watch videos directly on the site.
Responsive UI : The layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
Minimalist Design : Clean and simple design inspired by the YouTube interface.


TECHNOLOGIES USED :

HTML5 : Provides the structure for the web pages, including the video elements and forms.
CSS3 : Styles the layout and ensures the design is responsive and visually appealing on all devices.
JavaScript (ES6) : Adds dynamic functionality, enabling user interactions like searching for and playing videos.


DEMO :

Here's a quick overview of what VidTube currently offers : 

Homepage Interaction : Navigate the homepage with a working search bar.
Video Playback : Click on any video from the results to play it using the built-in player.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS :

Additional Pages : Expansion beyond the homepage to add more features like a detailed video page, playlists, etc.
Video Recommendation : Display related videos based on search or currently playing video.
User Interactions : Adding like, comment, and share features for enhanced engagement.


WHY THIS PROJECT ?

This project was developed to practice my frontend development skills, focusing specifically on essential elements of a video-sharing platform. While Iâ€™ve only added basic homepage and video playback functionalities, the project serves as a foundation for building more complex web applications in the future.
